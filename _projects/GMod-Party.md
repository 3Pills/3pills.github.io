GMod Party is a third party mod for Garry's Mod which I'm currently developing with my partner Saana. The project will be written entirely in Lua, conforming to the standards of GMod's Lua scripting API. The goal of this mod is to reconstruct gameplay of the original three Mario Party games with a modernised framework. It's currently in pre-alpha state, but development is underway and it is looking promising so far.
