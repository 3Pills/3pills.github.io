desc: <p>Neural Quake is an executable modification for the original Quake that adds neural learning capabilities to the game. The goal of this project was to develop a neural AI that could guide the player through the game world and reach the end of the stage. You can read more about the development process and overall result in my blog, <a href="/blogs/neural_research">here.</a></p>
