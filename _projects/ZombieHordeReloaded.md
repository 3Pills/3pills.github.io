desc: <p>Zombie Horde Reloaded is a remake of Zombie Horde, originally for Counter-Strike Source. When the original became unsupported due to engine changes, I took it upon myself to remake it for GMod. This project is currently in development limbo,  and I don't know if it will ever be finished... As is the fate of all poorly managed personal projects :(.</p><p>If you wish to see more information on this particular project, visit its exclusive website <a href="http://www.zombiehorde-reloaded.com/">here.</a></p>
