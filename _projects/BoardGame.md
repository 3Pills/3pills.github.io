desc: <p>'Board Game' is a... erm... board game... but it's online! and you can play it in browser! Well, if you download the source code. It's built in PHP using the Laravel web framework, which means it requires a server to host it as well as store database information for it. It's not entirely finished so I haven't hosted it anywhere. You can read more about my time spent with this game <a href="/blogs/webgame">here.</a> I do have plans to remake this whilst learning NodeJS, so it may be available to be played in the future!</p>
