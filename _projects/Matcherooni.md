<p> A simple match the shapes game inspired by Tetris and Columns, made for a university project. Has the nice gimmick of having each block be comprised of popular Twitch emotes. 
Developed entirely in JavaScript using the Cocos2D HTML5 framework, this game is completely browser-based and a decent bit of fun.</p>
<p>Because it is browser based, I have set it up for all to play, right <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/projects/Matcherooni">here</a> on this website!</p>
