desc: <p>Project Laser was my final project for my university course. It was a project designed to target a niche market, in this case, Google Cardboard users. I've not cleaned it up for production yet, so the source code is not available, but it has been built in Unity using Google's publically available GoogleVR library. More information can be read on my blog, <a href="/blogs/cardboard_vr">here.</a> I'm not sure whether this project will ever be commercially released, but the possibility is always there.</p>
