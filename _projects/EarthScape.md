<p>EarthScape was a small dungeon-crawling adventure project I developed in a group. It was produced in collaboration with 2 other programmers and 1 artist as part of my programming education. Focused on puzzle solving and exploration, EarthScape was created cross-platform for the PC and PS Vita.</p>
