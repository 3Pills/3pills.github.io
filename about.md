### More Information
<div class="text_container">
  <p> Heading this blog is my first forray into building a portfolio for myself, as well as my own personal means of disciplining myself. It's hard to keep your development milestones documented in a fast-paced and passion-driven environment like games programming, and this website is my attempt to commit to this. I say passion-driven because that's exactly what I am. </p>

  <p> Video games have been ever present throughout my entire life, and started with my Nintendo 64 and Gameboy Colour consoles, which I cherished throughout my childhood. However, whilst these consoles were mainly marketed as casual ones, I usually found myself incredibly invested in the competetive aspects of each. </p>

  <p> Constantly aiming to get every game I owned to 100% completion (including my pokemon games, which involved getting every pokemon ever, something not particularly easy as a naive kid), I started to gear myself towards understanding game mechanics much more thoroughly in order to properly succeed at them. </p>

  <p> It was probably here where my interest for programming began to stem. Understanding the intricacies of a game's code and how to abuse the abundance of glitches within a game engaged me to the point where I could imagine myself one day making the kind of game I wrestled with so much. Sooooo uhhhh yeah, I guess that explains the passion behind what I do pretty well. Sure do hope someone reads this ( noone will :^) ). </p>
