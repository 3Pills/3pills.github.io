<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p> What's up? Name's Stephen Koren and I'm a 20 year old student currently studying for a Bachelor of Games and Virtual Worlds (Programming) at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment. </p>

<h3>What is this place?</h3>
<p> You're currently on my own portfolio website.
Heading this website is my first forray into building a name for myself, as well as my own personal means of marking my accomplishments. It's hard to keep your development milestones 
documented in a fast-paced and inspiration-driven environment like games programming, and this website is my attempt to commit these flairs of passion and inspiration to some form of documentation. 
I say passion and inspiration because that's exactly how I feel about games and bringing them to life through code.</p>

<p> Video games have been ever present throughout my entire life, and started with my Nintendo 64 and Gameboy Colour consoles, which I cherished throughout my childhood. 
However, whilst these consoles were mainly marketed as casual ones, I usually found myself incredibly invested in the competitive aspects of each. 
Constantly aiming to get every game I owned to 100% completion (including my pokemon games, which involved getting every pokemon ever, something not particularly easy as a naive kid without the interweb). I started to gear myself towards understanding game mechanics much more thoroughly in order to properly succeed at these goals. </p>

<p> It was probably here where my interest for programming began to stem. Understanding the intricacies of a game requires an educated guess at the underlying code's design and how to abuse it. It was this aspect of games that engaged me to the point where I could imagine myself one day making the kind of game I wrestled with so much. </p>
