  <p> Hohhh, you found the top secret 8-bit webpage. Here I put on show all my 8-bit remakes of songs from video games I've played. 
  The plan with these is to one day include them in a fan-game that I'll probably never make.</p>

    <h3>Courtroom Lounge - Phoenix Wright: Ace Attourney</h3>
    <p>This is the song that plays before cases in the original Phoenix Wright. Not too much to say about this, made it cause it was quick and Phoenix Wright is sick.</p>

    <h3>Emotion - Tsukihime EverAfter OST</h3>
    <p>I thought for the longest time that this was the original piece made for the Tsukihime VN. Apparently it's not, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhcLmWHlD_g" target="_blank">this</a> is. 
    I personally like the reproduced version a lot more, for the mysterious sounding instrumentation and heavy reverberation, as well as just its general cohesiveness (because it's not TRASH). 
    I'm glad that I've managed to capture that off-beat feeling in what I currently have of it. P.S. Hisui is best girl.</p>

    <h3>Final Fall - Sonic XG</h3>
    <p>Hold on, isn't this the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMtWq2kA_nc" target="_blank">Staff Roll</a> from Marvel Vs. Capcom? Wrong. 
    My exposure to this song begins and ends with the BGM for the only level in a <a href="https://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_XG" target="_blank">Sonic fan-game</a> demo from 2007. 
    The completed game is still not finished but the creator has been posting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkF2VDXC9Gs" target="_blank">updates</a> recently. 
    I've been waiting a good while for this game to come out, damnit.</p>

    <h3>Menu 2 - Super Smash Bros. Melee</h3>
    <p>This song has definitely been the most challenging to translate, but it's definitely turning out to be the best one. 
    There's so much going on in the song that recreating it by ear (I do that) is pretty darn hard.</p>
