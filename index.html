<h3>Welcome to my website!</h3>
<p>You've stumbled upon the page of Stephen Koren, the greatest programmer ever (in training). It is my hope to one day pierce the heavens with my coding knowledge!</p>

<p>I'm a programmer currently studying for my Bachelor's Degree of Games and Virtual Worlds, in the form of a cross coordinated online course with the Canberra Institute of Technology and the Academy of Interactive Entertainment.
It is my goal to spend as much of my free time during these years as possible devoted to exploring and learning the power of different languages, APIs and frameworks, and what I can create with them.</p>

<p>In this website, you can expect to find a list of projects I've had a part in breathing life into.
You'll also find blogs for some of these projects, where I muse on the experiences I had during them, and what lessons I took away from the projects.</p>
