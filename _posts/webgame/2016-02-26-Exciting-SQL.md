<p>This post is an introductory post for my new sub-blog, where I detail the development process behind my upcoming web-based game project.</p>

<p>This project is being developed as part of my bachelor's degree, but that isn't to say I won't give it a touch of my magic. The requirements for this projects are that it has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An entirely online HTTP-based interface.</li>
  <li>A database backend which stores information via SQL, with data that can be modified simultaneously.</li>
  <li>An infrastructure that is secure and conforms to MVC architecture.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's pretty much the requirements. This excites me quite a great deal, because this is all back-end stuff! There's no requirements for the actual front-end game! Therefore, I shall deliberate on the contents of the game itself, but I've decided that it's, at least, going to be a 100% Orange Juice type board game.</p>

<p> It's always nice to have a chance to be a bit of a dorky weeby dweeb and this project should hopefully give me that opportunity. Right now though, I'll have to put some serious consideration into how the back-end will be structured first, because that's what matters for the assessment.</p>
