This week I've finally spent some time working on the first level, which I've decided arbitrarily will be some kind of castle-y watchtower type thing. It will start out in a hilly area filled with stationary tanks, before directing the player into a large castle type place with ramps and wall turrets. Sound interesting? Here's how it looks:

The goal of this level from a design standpoint will be to introduce the player to the shooting mechanics within VR. Because of the relatively unorthodox nature of the control scheme, it's worth having a level where players can get accustomed to the basic controls of the game. Non-moving tanks will require basic horizontal head movement in order to aim and fire at. Wall turrets will require vertical awareness. After this point moving enemies and aerial moving enemies can be placed at will, as the player will have demonstrated ability in handling these enemies.

From an aesthetic perspective, having a larger, more sprawling environment is somewhat necessary for a VR game, I feel. If the environment was smaller with more closed in rooms, objects rushing past could disorient players, as well as obstruct the camera.
