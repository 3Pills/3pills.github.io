My first week of development was a slow one. The main work I completed involved spent establishing the version control systems in place for the development, as well as polishing the control scheme of the tank.

With a schedule set out before me I'm feeling much more confident in the completability of this project than otherwise. My artist has already sent some preview shots of the tank in development and it looks pretty good! Here's one of those shots.

We're planning a sci-fi-esque look and feel to the game so we don't have to maintain strict accuracy towards any existing tank. This will make the overall creation process less rigid for my artist, which is always a plus! For next week, I'll be continuing work on the tank and designing the first level and enemies within the game.
