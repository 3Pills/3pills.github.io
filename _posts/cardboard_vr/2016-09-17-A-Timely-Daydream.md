This week saw rather little progress made on the game due to focus being placed on other projects. However, what caught my eye over the past week is Google's recently unveiled Google Daydream project, which is basically a much higher performance version of Google Cardboard. What's the relevance of this to my cardboard project? Well, daydream is designed around the use of an external controller, and guess what my game uses? Hmmm, it seems awfully convenient, doesn't it?

As a result, I've implemented the latest version of the Google SDK for Unity which is designed to have dual support for either cardboard or daydream, at least on the programming side of things. This doesn't change much for the course of this project - mostly because the hardware for Daydream is still unreleased, and will only work for new phones (I just got a Nexus 6 a couple of months ago, dangit!). The most recent versions of the Cardboard SDK in Unity have actually been renamed into GoogleVR, which is compatible with both Cardboard and Daydream, so I could theoretically immediately port the game to Daydream with 0 issues. But, for now, due to both hardware costs, and how much this could skew the niche of the market unfavourably, I will refrain from providing anything but secondary untested support for Daydream. Bluetooth controllers it is, gents!
