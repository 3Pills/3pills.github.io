<p>Development on Project Laser has officialy begun! I've spent the last week dicussing various aspects of the project with my contracted artist and things are going smoothly. I've come to understand even with what little project's I've been involved in that communication is <em>key</em> in a team project and thus, ensuring a mutual understanding at these early hours will pay dividends in the long run.</p>

<p>I've done this by establishing a set of a goals to aim for and a schedule to adhere to. Often-times when I find myself twiddling my thumbs on a project it's because I don't have a clear goal in mind or a time to complete it by. Providing both of these goals focuses a worker's attention in a timely and effective manner. It's pretty dang good.</p>

<p>Because my artist's doing this for nothing but the goal of experience (shoutouts the that, by the way), I've tried to minimise his workload per week to something manageable. He definitely has other commitments so I'll be doing more than him in the long run, but the schedule has been designed around this fact so it will be fine.</p> 

<p>Anyways, I'm rambling but the key is to prepare your staff extremely mindfully for <em>any</em> project. You want maximum efficiency from everyone, not just yourself.</p>
