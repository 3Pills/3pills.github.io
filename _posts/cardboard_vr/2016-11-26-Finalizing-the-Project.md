Now that most features have been properly implemented into the game, I spent this week polishing the last bits and preparing things for a presentation I'll be giving on the project. This was a nice learning experience for learning to deploy to mobile and I'm glad I had a chance to do it! Unfortunately this week is more of a formality than anything... I haven't got much to report on progress wise. It's been a real pleasure working on this project, I did enjoy figuring things out for Unity once again, that big ol' crazy game engine that. Haha, until next time people!
