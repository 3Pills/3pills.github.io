I've yet to let up on the steam this week! Over the past week I've managed to recruit an artist for part-time work on the game over the course of its development! That's pretty neato, ey? As such, I've begun divvying up work for the both of us via a Project Timeline, as part of the Project Management documentation. I've stipulated that for each requirement he should get a couple of weeks to work through it in order to properly produce quality without feeling too rushed. I don't expect his commitment to be extremely high, given that it's not his project, so I've kept his workload within reasonable amounts.

As for my game concept, I've been steadily narrowing down the specifics of the game. I've been discussing with a friend the validity of the various perspectives of a game for use in the VR simulation. I'm stuck trying to decide whether traditional first-person within the vr or a third-person perspective is more relevant for use in the game. On one hand, first person will be much more immersive, but on the other hand, a tank game in third-person would give a greater degree of vision of incoming enemies. 

Looking at a Gamasutra article<sup><a href="#s1">[1]</a></sup> on the subject, I feel like third-person will be much more appropriate, but this will open up a rather large area of uncertainty when considering the Google Cardboard is a first-person based peripheral. I may try some experiments with the camera system and see what I can do...

What do the readers think? Feel free to comment below if you have anything to share on the subject!
