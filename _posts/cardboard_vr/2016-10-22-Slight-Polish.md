Hi guys! Another week in on the project! Development has been a bit slow this week, as I've decided to invest time into catching up on my neural networking project, which you'll be able to see has just started its implementation phase. That's a bit too slow for my liking, so I've put it much higher on the priority list than this Cardboard project.

I've spent a little bit of time this week polishing the level a bit, adding some trees and particles throughout the level here and there and balancing fog and optimisations for mobile. The process wasn't too involved, but it should suffice. Next week I'll be working on Interactive objects (Buttons, doors), as well as menus. Stay tuned!
