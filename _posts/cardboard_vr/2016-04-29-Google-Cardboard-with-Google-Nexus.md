<p>In preparation for my Google Cardboard project I've decided to secure a Google Nexus 6, one of Google's pure Android phones, for use with the project. This should give me compatability and testing with the latest versions of Android as they become available, as the pure Android OS of the device means it will upgrade without problems.</p>

<p>Aside from this, I've put more research into the types of VR apps that Google Cardboard supports. Generally these are either video players, silly AR things or fixed position 3D simulation. A few games exist, such as Proton Pulse<sup><a href="#s1">[1]</a></sup>, BombSquad VR<sup><a href="#s2">[2]</a></sup> and Caaaaardboard!<sup><a href="#s3">[3]</a></sup> Whilst Proton Pulse and Cardboard! rely exclusively on a single VR device, BombSquad utilises both VR and a secondary device as a controller. This idea interests me, as I feel one of the problems with Google Cardboard for use with games is the distinct lack of any input, save for a single button to the side of the cardboard.</p>

<p>Whilst I may not be able to make a fully fledged game due to lack of artistic and design talent, the idea of interconnecting two devices with one acting as input and the other as the vision sounds quite appealing. Apparently, there's quite the market for android bluetooth controllers<sup><a href="#s4">[4]</a></sup>, which I may have to invest into to use throughout the project. That being said, I'm not entirely sure how easy it would be to detect and interpret the bluetooth controller within the game... I'll have to see for myself when I can get working on a VR app myself!</p>
