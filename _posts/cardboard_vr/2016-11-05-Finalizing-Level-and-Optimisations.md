Unfortunately this week I got a little sidetracked with other priorities... Because the project is nearly finished I've pushed development back a week. Not everything is lost however! I took a day to optimize the game for mobile, moving the skybox from the procedural, realtime skybox to a flat texture. I've also optimised various textures and lights for mobile as well, so performance has been improved across the board. Ultimately, the performance has improved, so this is good :). I've also finalised the overall layout of the level with a reasonably expansive hill area, a castle and a lakeside area. Things will be looking good from this point on!

When it comes for future work on the project, I may also be busy next week, but work on the menu will definitely have begun by this point. I just have to keep at it and deliver the goods!
