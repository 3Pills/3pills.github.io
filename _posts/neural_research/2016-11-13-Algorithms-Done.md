PHEW! It's finally done! And by done I mean that the neural network is actually controlling the game in a seemingly... intelligent way. If, by intelligent, you mean "spins around while walking directly into lava and dying instantly on the first test". Haha, they like to say that neural networks will surprise you with their intelligence. Well I'm still waiting! :P

But seriously, this week was spent fixing some embarrassing and frustrating bugs, including incorrect checks in for loops, a Random_Float() 0-1 ranged decimal returning function that returns an int, and various memory mismanagement errors. Some of these kept me banging my head against the wall for a bit, which is unfortunate because I wanted to get more done this week. Whatever.

Next week I'll be working on debug displaying a graph of the entire network, rather than just the input, and tweaking the fitness gathering capabilities of the network.
