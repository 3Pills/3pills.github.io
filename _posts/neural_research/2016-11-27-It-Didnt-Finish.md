Welp, I have to break the news. The neural AI did not actually finish the level. In fact, it didn't even come close! Unfortunately, it got stuck at various early points in the level and just generally failed to evolve properly. Now it comes down to figuring out exactly why this is the case.

I believe the cause of this issue to be that of the inputs passed into the network in the first place. These inputs are very rough and do not really provide the network with any reasonable information it might be interested in. As of now, it simply tells the network about walls in its general vicinity. This is not really that great! I feel a better network would identify points of interest in the level somehow... I'm not entirely sure how but... ugh! It's just been a little bit disappointing for me. That being said, I'm still pleased that I even made it this far in the project. I was expecting things to be quite hard, but I actually managed to get most of what I wanted out of this project done! I just didn't get any reasonable results... what a shame!

Next week, I'll be spending most of my time documenting the project and what I've done with it, so this marks the final feature-driven development week of the project. I guess I'll also stop posting updates, seeing as I won't be doing any more work. It's been a wild ride, but I guess its time to look at how I got here and figure out where to go next with this, if I even want to... Peace guys!
