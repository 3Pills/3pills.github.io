<p>For my final project, I've definitely decided to take on the niche market of Google Glasses. I'll be developing for the android platform, so I can use a decent spec phone to develop the app. According to Google's website<sup><a href="#s1">[1]</a></sup> the easiest game engine to develop Google Cardboard applications for within Android is Unity, which I'm already quite familiar with.</p>

<p>Although setting up such an application seems easy, it's fairly daunting when considering all the unique design aspects of VR. Accommodating for each will require a fairly large amount of testing and research prior. Google has a design guidelines page<sup><a href="#s2">[2]</a></sup> which identifies basic pitfalls of VR, but doesn't really offer any substantial advice on how to prevent it. Resolving these design issues will require careful and constant consideration put forth to specifically prevent each issue from occurring. Things like 'simulator sickness' and control issues are identified on the page.</p>

<p>Whilst design aspects are looming, what's most important is understanding the hardware that would be required to get the VR working. Right now I don't have access to a high end smartphone; a fact I'd be more than happy to change in the coming weeks. We'll see how things go from here.</p>
