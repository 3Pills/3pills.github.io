<p>Doing my current niche market research, I've come to consider a number of options in regards to my final business case. Personally, I'm quite interested in the area of graphics programming, so the use of a new shader technology like a compute shader seems quite interesting. Another interest of mine is artificial intelligence, but I can't exactly think of something with the focus of AI that would be useful as a technology for others to use.</p>

<p>When asking around the dinner table, my family present a number of interesting ideas aimed towards helping people with disabilities. One such idea that seemed feasible was a mobile application that would take advantage of a phone's GPS and camera to act in place of a guide dog for a blind person. Though this would be quite complicated to implement correctly, it is an interesting idea to consider.</p>

<p>With the prevalence of virtual reality in the collective conscience of today's gamers, I also feel something using that technology could be an appropriate area to research in. I don't think I'll have access to something expensive like the Oculus Rift or the Valve Vive, so Google Cardboard seems like the only area I could break into with this type of venture.</p>

<p>Another potential option is to release a Unity package of some kind. I've never worked with Unreal so Unity is my only option if I want to make something quality. I could do some kind of convenience package that alleviates some of Unity's backend requirements, much like iTween does for smoothing object movements and rotations.<sup><a href="#s1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Picking from these potential niches is proving to be quite difficult, however, and I can't seem to settle on a single idea. Hopefully I can clear up a potential project in the near future.</p>
