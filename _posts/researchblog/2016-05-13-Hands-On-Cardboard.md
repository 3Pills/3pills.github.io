<p>My first week experimenting with the Cardboard has proven somewhat promising for the overall bedstone of my product ideas. The google demos provided within the main cardboard app were fairly interesting and engaging demonstrations of what cardboard can do. While I was expecting there to be glaring flaws with the view-tracking of the phone, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it functioned. My main gripe with the view-tracking of the Cardboard was that it wasn't entirely 1:1. On my phone it acknowledged my head was moving pretty much immediately, but the phone kind of stuttered trying to figure out where I was looking, which was the main deal-breaker in a perfect VR experience.</p>

<p>On top of my cardboard experience, I also got to mess around with the my bluetooth controller. I didn't use it for a cardboard app, because there wasn't any support for it in the demos, but I did mess around with some game emulators in order to get a feel for how it works and it works pretty well with a minimal latency. From what I could find, the game I mentioned in a previous post, BombSquad, doesn't use cardboard in as an integral part of the games mechanics; there's even a non-cardboard version. The game doesn't rely on view controls, which means I'll be trying something quite unique for my goal with cardboard. </p>

<p>I don't want to lose out on my already small target market of Google Cardboard users in favour of those with blue-tooth controllers, so I may have to design for a controller whilst also allowing people without controllers the ability to complete the game in some form. I'm still not entirely sure what my game will be, but I do know the basic scope of it and how I want it to funciton. I'm thinking some sort of laser shooter akin to Star Fox may be engaging, but we'll have to see.</p>

<p>I've already set up my first application on Cardboard. Setting up a Cardboard project with Unity was as simple as loading in a demo provided by Google<sup><a href="#s1">[1]</a></sup> into Unity and compiling that project to Android. There are some integral scripts and setups that do need to be accounted for, but that will have to wait for later. For now concepting and brainstorming is key.</p>
