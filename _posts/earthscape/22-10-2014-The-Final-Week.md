Ah, the final week of the project! It's time to get incredibly over-worked and worried. Except we totally won't cause we have a plan. Throughout this final week we'll be focusing exclusively on bug fixes and documentation. The game at this point is passable so we don't feel pressured to add any new and poorly implemented features right before our time is up. 

In any case, today was spent bringing things up to scratch with the Vita version. This involved fixing the saving / loading feature for the game and sorting out some poor optimisation issues. Not much else to say about today, the fact that it's a half day didn't give us as much time to perform.
