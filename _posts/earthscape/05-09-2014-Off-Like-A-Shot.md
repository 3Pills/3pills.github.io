Development continues today as we begin work on the game code itself. Whilst I was initially worried yesterday things seem to have picked up smoothly and the group is going well creating various bits of code. 

Nathan has gone about creating the base entity class for our in-game objects and Ronnie is working on importing .tmx map files. So far things are going well and we are working very hard right off the bat, something which eases my fears that we will fall behind at some point.

Aside from these few observations, not much has happened since yesterday. Will be looking forward to working on this project, I do have high hopes for our group. :)
