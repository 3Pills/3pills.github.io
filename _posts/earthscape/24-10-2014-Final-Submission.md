Phew! The final day has come and gone and it was spent almost exclusively on documentation. Fun times. ' ^'

We finalised our technical documentation, design documentation, did a post-mortem report, signed a work agreement and finished our own individual peer reviews. Game was pretty good; not much else to say. I think that it could've been quite a bit better, but we did well with the time we had.
