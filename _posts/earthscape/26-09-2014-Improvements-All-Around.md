As the Tiled implementation was so slick yesterday, I decided to add a player spawn point and enemy spawn points as well. This did take a few hours though, as the code we're using took a little reading to understand. It did wind up looking really good though. I also added an extra layer to the map, for things below the player's platform, to compliment those overhead.

Apparently my touch input was completely broken as well, so I spent a good few hours figuring out exactly what was wrong with it. I just decided to use the PSM built-in touch library, rather than Monogame's one. This worked and all was well. This took me to the weekly play-testing session, which was business as usual.

All is going well with this project, and the code is finally starting to show tangible results :)
