Today was our third play-test day, and as such we spent the first half setting up for the Vita and fixing the remaining bugs in our code. The main problems we had going through the vita were sound effects and minimap. The minimap required a lot of optimisation to be able to render correctly in the game without lagging. Sound effects, however, were lacking the correct method implementation for PSM. Unfortunately I wasn't the one who was in charge of it so I can't really give insight as to how it was fixed.
